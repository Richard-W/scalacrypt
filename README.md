Scalacrypt
==========

Scalacrypt provides advanced cryptographic functions for scala projects. It wraps the
javax.crypto API and provides a few things that are not implemented there. So far
this project only provides symmetric encryption. This may change in the future.

This project is under heavy development and not suited for production!!!

To add this scalacrypt to your sbt project just add the following line to your build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "xyz.wiedenhoeft" %% "scalacrypt" % "0.1.1"
```

You can use the current snapshot by putting the following lines in your build.sbt:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")

libraryDependencies += "xyz.wiedenhoeft" %% "scalacrypt" % "0.2-SNAPSHOT"
```

Symmetric encryption
--------------------

Every algorithm that encrypts symmetrically extends the SymmetricEncryption trait. This
trait contains the following abstract methods (prior to 0.2 these methods do not exist):

```scala
/** Encrypts an iterator with a given key. */
def encrypt(data: Iterator[Seq[Byte]], key: KeyType): Iterator[Seq[Byte]]

/** Decrypts an iterator with a given key. */
def decrypt(data: Iterator[Seq[Byte]], key: KeyType): Iterator[Try[Seq[Byte]]]
```

Also the trait contains the following methods wrapping the abstract methods (prior
to 0.2 they were abstract):

```scala
/** Encrypts data with a given key. */
def encrypt(data: Seq[Byte], key: KeyType): Seq[Byte]

/** Decrypts data using a given key. */
def decrypt(data: Seq[Byte], key: KeyType): Try[Seq[Byte]]
```

KeyType is a specific child of SymmetricKey. For AES256 it is SymmetricKey256 for example.
You get the idea.

For secure encryption a pure SymmetricEncryption should never be used as an attacker would
be able to flip any byte he wishes. For this purpose there is the SymmetricCipherSuite class which
signs the output of an encryption algorithm using a MAC. It extends SymmetricEncryption too,
so usage is the same.

Binary format
-------------

The AES implementations use cipher block chaining mode (CBC) which randomizes the output
independent of the plaintext. The IV is prepended to the encrypted data (the first 16 bytes).

The SymmetricCipherSuite class signs the encrypted data and appends the signature. The offset depends on the
length of the specific Mac.

Contributing
------------

* Bug reports are appreciated as much as actual code contributions. Do not hesitate to report if you encounter a problem.
* All parts of this library MUST never throw exceptions. Functions should return a Try if they might fail. Also if you encounter an exception i consider it a bug and would appreciate if you reported it here.
* The library should be kept extensible. It MUST not be necessary to contribute to this library to implement new algorithms. However if you think an algorithm might be of use for others do not hesitate to merge it.
* This project was born out of necessity. There seems to be no other project in scala providing this functionality and i needed it. I am no cryptography expert but i read a few articles about best practices for encryption. You are welcome to tell me where i am wrong. In fact i will not consider this project stable until a few people who **really** know what they are doing reviewed it.
