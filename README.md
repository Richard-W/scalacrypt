Scalacrypt
==========

Scalacrypt provides advanced cryptographic functions for scala projects. It wraps the
javax.crypto API and provides a few things that are not implemented there. So far
this project only provides symmetric encryption. This may change in the future.

This project is under heavy development and not suited for production!!!
